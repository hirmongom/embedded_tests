 * @brief       Usart communication test program
 * 
 * @details     This program demonstrates basic USART communication using USART2 on the STM32F410RB 
 *              microcontroller. The program configures the GPIO pins PA2 and PA3 as alternate 
 *              function mode to enable USART2 communication. It sets up USART2 with a specific 
 *              baud rate for serial communication.

 * @note        This program uses simple polling for data transmission, where it waits for the TXE 
 *              (Transmit Data Register Empty) flag to be set before sending each character. 
 *              For more robust USART communication in real-world applications, an interrupt-driven 
 *              or DMA-based approach is recommended.
