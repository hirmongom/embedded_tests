/* 
 * Configuring the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) for the desired system clock:
 * 
 * 1. PLL_M: This value is directly set to the lowest bits [5:0] of the PLLCFGR register.
 *           It divides the input clock before it's fed to the VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator).
 * 
 * 2. PLL_N: This value is shifted to the left by 6 bits and set to bits [14:6] of the PLLCFGR 
 *           register.
 *           It determines the multiplication factor for the VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator).
 * 
 * 3. PLL_P: This value determines the division factor for the main system clock.
 *           The formula `((PLL_P >> 1) - 1)` is used to convert the actual division factor 
 *           (2, 4, 6, or 8) to the respective 2-bit representation in the PLLCFGR register.
 *           This value is then shifted to the left by 16 bits and set to bits [17:16].
 * 
 * 4. PLL_Q: This value is shifted to the left by 24 bits and set to bits [27:24] of the PLLCFGR 
 *           register.
 *           It determines the division factor for the USB OTG FS, SDIO, and RNG clocks.
 * 
 * 5. (1 << 22): This bit sets the PLL source to HSE (High-Speed External) clock. If this bit is 
 *               reset, then HSI (High-Speed Internal) is used as the PLL source.
