 * @brief       LED Blinking Application
 *
 * @details     This file contains a simple program to blink an LED connected 
 *              to Pin PA5 of the STM32F10RB microcontroller.
 *              The led blinks rapidly while the user button is not pressed.
 *              If the user button is pressed, the blinking speed lowers until the
 *              button is released
