1. Measure signal of the receiver and transmitter pins:
  - PA2 (Tx) = 0V, Logic Low?
  - PA3 (Rx) = 0V, Logic Low?

2. Test different USART Peripheral
  - Still nothing, although by checking USART1 register address (0x40011000) i can see
    that there's nothing configured, all bits set to 0 for all 7 32bit registers, need
    to review code.
  
3. Test transmission between different USART Peripherals
