 * @brief       GPIO Button and LED Control
 * 
 *              This code initializes GPIO ports, configures a button on PC13, and controls 
 *              a LED on PA5.
 *              While the button is pressed, the LED is turned on, and when the button is 
 *              released, the LED is turned off.
 *
 * @details     The code performs the following steps:
 *                  1. Initializes the clock for the GPIO ports.
 *                  2. Configures GPIOA (PA5) as an output pin for the LED and GPIOC (PC13) 
 *                      as an input pin for the button.
 *                  3. Implements a main loop that continuously checks the state of the button.
 *                      - While the button is pressed (PC13 is high), 
 *                          the LED is turned on (PA5 is set high).
 *                      - While the button is released (PC13 is low), 
 *                          the LED is turned off (PA5 is set low)
