 * @brief       Linker script for the STM32F10 line of microcontrollers
 * 
 * @details     This linker script is designed for the STM32F10 line of microcontrollers,
 *              specifically the STM32F410RB microcontroller. It provides memory layout
 *              and section placement information for the firmware image.
 * 
 *              The script defines the memory regions for the FLASH (program memory) and SRAM
 *              (data memory) and specifies the placement of various sections such as .text,
 *              .rodata, .data, and .bss.
 * 
 *              The .text section contains the interrupt vector table, code, and read-only data.
 *              It is placed in the FLASH memory.
 * 
 *              The .data section contains initialized global and static variables that are copied
 *              from the FLASH to the SRAM during startup. It is placed in the SRAM but loaded from
 *              the FLASH memory.
 * 
 *              The .bss section contains uninitialized global and static variables that are
 *              zero-initialized during startup. It is placed in the SRAM.
 * 
 *              The .heap and .stack sections, which are responsible for dynamic memory allocation
 *              and the program stack, are left unspecified in the linker script. This allows for
 *              flexibility in memory allocation at runtime, avoiding potential limitations
 *              imposed by fixed sizes. However, it should be noted that this approach may incur
 *              some efficiency overhead.
