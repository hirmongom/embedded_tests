Welcome to the {\bfseries{STM32\+F410\+RB Microcontroller Applications}} repository!

This project serves as a storage for all my applications specifically implemented for the STM32\+F410\+RB microcontroller. The applications in this repository are designed to explore and utilize the various functionalities of the microcontroller board. Through testing and experimentation, I aim to create applications that leverage these functionalities in practical ways.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Project Objective}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
The main objective of this project is to gain knowledge and experience in working with the STM32\+F410\+RB microcontroller. By creating a variety of applications, I seek to discover and understand the different capabilities and features of the microcontroller board. These applications act as a learning platform, allowing me to explore the nuances of the STM32\+F410\+RB and develop the skills required for future, more complex projects. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of the Cortex-\/\+M4 microprocessor architecture and gain broader knowledge about ARM microprocessors which are widely used in the industry.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Approach and Benefits}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
All the applications in this repository are developed using a bare metal approach, meaning I do not rely on any libraries or frameworks, including CMSIS. While this decision presents challenges in terms of implementation, it offers several benefits. By working at a lower level, without the abstractions provided by libraries, I gain a more fundamental understanding of how microcontrollers operate. This hands-\/on approach allows me to delve into the intricacies of the STM32\+F410\+RB and comprehend its inner workings.

By implementing everything from scratch, I have the opportunity to gain insights into the underlying hardware and software interactions of the microcontroller. This knowledge I feel is invaluable when it comes to troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and developing efficient code. Additionally, the bare metal approach fosters a deeper appreciation for the complexities of embedded systems and equips me with the skills necessary to develop robust and tailored solutions.

Through this project, I aspire to build a solid foundation in microcontroller development and expand my knowledge and expertise in working with the STM32\+F410\+RB and Cortex-\/\+M4 architecture.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Previous Experience}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
I have prior experience in bare metal embedded software development, particularly with the Texas Instruments Tiva TM4\+C123\+GXL evaluation board. During that time, I developed applications to test various features of the board, including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The GPIOF registry
\item External Input and Output
\item Interrupts
\item Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
\item ADC Interrupt
\item Timers
\item Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
\item Universal Asynchronous Receiver-\/\+Transmitter (UART)
\end{DoxyItemize}

This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in bare metal programming and an understanding of the features and capabilities of microcontrollers. I will leverage this knowledge in my current project with the STM32\+F410\+RB microcontroller.
