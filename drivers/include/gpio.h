 * 
 * @brief       Header file for GPIO peripheral driver.
 * 
 * @details     This file provides the necessary definitions and functions for configuring 
 *              and controlling GPIO pins on the STM32F10RB microcontroller.
 * 
 * @see         RM0401 Reference Manual, Page 135 for more information on GPIO configuration.
 * 
 * @note        This file will grow as I keep finding more needs and adding functionality
 * 
 * @warning     Untested
 * 
 * @todo        Need higher abstraction
 *              Doxygen comment blocks
