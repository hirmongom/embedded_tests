/**
 * @file        err.c
 * 
 * @brief       Error Number and Error Code
 * 
 * @details     This file defines a combined error information structure that consists 
 *              of an error number and an error code.
 *              The error number represents the type or category of the error, while the 
 *              error code provides additional specific information about the error.
 * 
 *              The error information is stored in a 32-bit memory location, allowing 
 *              for convenient access and manipulation of the error number and error code 
 *              using a single variable. The structure contains two 16-bit fields:
 *              `errorNumber` and `errorCode`.
 * 
 *              The `errno` variable, defined with the `__attribute__((section(".errno")))` 
 *              attribute, is used to store the combined error information. By default, both 
 *              the error number and error code are initialized to 0.
 *              They can be updated as needed throughout the program execution to reflect 
 *              different error scenarios.
